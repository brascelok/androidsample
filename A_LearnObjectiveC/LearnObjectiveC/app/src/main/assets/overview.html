	<p>Objective-C is general-purpose language that is developed on top of C Programming language by adding features of Small Talk programming language making it an object-oriented language. It is primarily used in developing iOS and Mac OS X operating systems as well as its applications.</p>

<p>Initially, Objective-C was developed by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP OS from whom it was taken over by Apple for its iOS and Mac OS X.</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

<p>Fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:</p>

<ul>
	<li>

		<p>Encapsulation</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>Data hiding</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>Inheritance</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>Polymorphism</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Code</h2><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

int main (int argc, const char * argv[])
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog (@&quot;hello world&quot;);
&nbsp; &nbsp;[pool drain];
&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>

<h2>Foundation Framework</h2>

<p>Foundation Framework provides large set of features and they are listed below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>

		<p>It includes a list of extended datatypes like NSArray, NSDictionary, NSSet and so on.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>It consists of a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>It provides features for URL handling, utilities like date formatting, data handling, error handling, etc.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objective-C</h2>

<p>The most important thing to do when learning Objective-C is to focus on concepts and not get lost in language technical details.</p>

<p>The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer; that is, to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old ones.</p>

<h2>Use of Objective-C</h2>

<p>Objective-C, as mentioned earlier, is used in iOS and Mac OS X. It has large base of iOS users and largely increasing Mac OS X users. And since Apple focuses on quality first and its wonderful for those who started learning Objective-C.</p>
