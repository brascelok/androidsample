<p>The Objective-C programming language provides a keyword called <strong>typedef</strong>, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term <strong>BYTE</strong> for one-byte numbers:</p><pre>typedef unsigned char BYTE;</pre>

<p>After this type definition, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type<strong>unsigned char, for example:</strong>.</p><pre>BYTE &nbsp;b1, b2;</pre>

<p>By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows:</p><pre>typedef unsigned char byte;</pre>

<p>You can use <strong>typedef</strong> to give a name to user-defined data type as well. For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows:</p><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

typedef struct Books
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSString *title;
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSString *author;
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSString *subject;
&nbsp; &nbsp;int book_id;

} Book;

int main( )
{

&nbsp; &nbsp;Book book;
&nbsp; &nbsp;book.title = @&quot;Objective-C Programming&quot;;
&nbsp; &nbsp;book.author = @&quot;TutorialsPoint&quot;;
&nbsp; &nbsp;book.subject = @&quot;Programming tutorial&quot;;
&nbsp; &nbsp;book.book_id = 100;
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog( @&quot;Book title : %@\n&quot;, book.title);
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog( @&quot;Book author : %@\n&quot;, book.author);
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog( @&quot;Book subject : %@\n&quot;, book.subject);
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog( @&quot;Book Id : %d\n&quot;, book.book_id);

&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p><pre>2013-09-12 12:21:53.745 demo[31183] Book title : Objective-C Programming

<h2>typedef vs #define</h2>

<p>The <strong>#define</strong> is a Objective-C directive, which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to <strong>typedef</strong> but with following differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>

		<p>The <strong>typedef</strong> is limited to giving symbolic names to types only whereas <strong>#define</strong>can be used to define alias for values as well, like you can define 1 as ONE, etc.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>The <strong>typedef</strong> interpretation is performed by the compiler where as <strong>#define</strong>statements are processed by the pre-processor.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Following is a simplest usage of #define:</p><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

#define TRUE &nbsp;1
#define FALSE 0

int main( )
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog( @&quot;Value of TRUE : %d\n&quot;, TRUE);
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog( @&quot;Value of FALSE : %d\n&quot;, FALSE);

&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>
