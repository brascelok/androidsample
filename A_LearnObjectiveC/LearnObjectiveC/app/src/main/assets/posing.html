	<p>Before starting about Posing in Objective-C, I would like to bring to your notice that Posing was declared deprecated in Mac OS X 10.5 and it&apos;s not available for use thereafter. So for those who are not concerned about these deprecated methods can skip this chapter.</p>

<p>Objective-C permits a class to wholly replace another class within a program. The replacing class is said to &quot;pose as&quot; the target class.</p>

<p>For the versions that supported posing, all messages sent to the target class are instead received by the posing class.</p>

<p>NSObject contains the poseAsClass: method that enables us to replace the existing class as said above.</p>

<h2>Restrictions in Posing</h2>

<ul>
	<li>

		<p>A class may only pose as one of its direct or indirect superclasses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>The posing class must not define any new instance variables that are absent from the target class (though it may define or override methods).</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>The target class may not have received any messages prior to the posing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>A posing class can call overridden methods through super, thus incorporating the implementation of the target class.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>A posing class can override methods defined in categories.</p>
	</li>
</ul><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

@interface MyString : NSString

@end

@implementation MyString

- (NSString *)stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:(NSString *)target
withString:(NSString *)replacement
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog(@&quot;The Target string is %@&quot;,target);
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog(@&quot;The Replacement string is %@&quot;,replacement);
}

@end

int main()
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
&nbsp; &nbsp;[MyString poseAsClass:[NSString class]];
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSString *string = @&quot;Test&quot;;
&nbsp; &nbsp;[string stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@&quot;a&quot; withString:@&quot;c&quot;];
&nbsp; &nbsp;[pool drain];
&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>

<p>Now when we compile and run the program in a older Mac OS X (V_10.5 or earlier), we will get the following result.</p><pre>2013-09-22 21:23:46.829 Posing[372:303] The Target string is a
2013-09-22 21:23:46.830 Posing[372:303] The Replacement string is c</pre>

<p>In the above example, we just polluted the original method with our implementation and this will get affected throughout all the NSString operations with the above method.</p>
