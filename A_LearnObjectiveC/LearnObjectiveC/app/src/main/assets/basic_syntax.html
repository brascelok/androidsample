	<p>You have seen a basic structure of Objective-C program, so it will be easy to understand other basic building blocks of the Objective-C programming language.</p>

<h2>Tokens in Objective-C</h2>

<p>A Objective-C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following Objective-C statement consists of six tokens:</p><pre>NSLog(@&quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;);</pre>

<p>The individual tokens are:</p><pre>NSLog
@
(
&quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;
)
;</pre>

<h2>Semicolons ;</h2>

<p>In Objective-C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.</p>

<p>For example, following are two different statements:</p><pre>NSLog(@&quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;);
return 0;</pre>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Comments are like helping text in your Objective-C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below:</p><pre>/* my first program in Objective-C */</pre>

<p>You can not have comments with in comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.</p>

<h2>Identifiers</h2>

<p>An Objective-C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>

<p>Objective-C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Objective-C is a <strong>case-sensitive</strong> programming language. Thus, <em>Manpower</em> and <em>manpower</em>are two different identifiers in Objective-C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers:</p><pre>mohd &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; zara &nbsp; &nbsp;abc &nbsp; move_name &nbsp;a_123
myname50 &nbsp; _temp &nbsp; j &nbsp; &nbsp; a23b9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;retVal</pre>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<p>The following list shows few of the reserved words in Objective-C. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.</p>

<h2>Whitespace in Objective-C</h2>

<p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and an Objective-C compiler totally ignores it.</p>

<p>Whitespace is the term used in Objective-C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement:</p><pre>int age;</pre>

<p>There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement,</p><pre>fruit = apples + oranges; &nbsp; // get the total fruit</pre>

<p>no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish for readability purpose.</p>
