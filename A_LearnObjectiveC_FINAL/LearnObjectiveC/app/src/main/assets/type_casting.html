<p>Type casting is a way to convert a variable from one data type to another data type. For example, if you want to store a long value into a simple integer then you can type cast long to int. You can convert values from one type to another explicitly using the <strong>cast operator</strong> as follows:</p><pre>(type_name) expression</pre>

<p>In Objective-C, we generally use CGFloat for doing floating point operation, which is derived from basic type of float in case of 32-bit and double in case of 64-bit. Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable by another to be performed as a floating-point operation:</p><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

int main()
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;int sum = 17, count = 5;
&nbsp; &nbsp;CGFloat mean;

&nbsp; &nbsp;mean = (CGFloat) sum / count;
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog(@&quot;Value of mean : %f\n&quot;, mean );

&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p><pre>2013-09-11 01:35:40.047 demo[20634] Value of mean : 3.400000</pre>

<p>It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of <strong>sum</strong> is first converted to type <strong>double</strong> and finally it gets divided by count yielding a double value.</p>

<p>Type conversions can be implicit which is performed by the compiler automatically or it can be specified explicitly through the use of the <strong>cast operator</strong>. It is considered good programming practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.</p>

<h2>Integer Promotion</h2>

<p>Integer promotion is the process by which values of integer type &quot;smaller&quot; than <strong>int</strong> or<strong>unsigned int</strong> are converted either to <strong>int</strong> or <strong>unsigned int</strong>. Consider an example of adding a character in an int:</p><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

int main()
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;int &nbsp;i = 17;
&nbsp; &nbsp;char c = &apos;c&apos;; /* ascii value is 99 */
&nbsp; &nbsp;int sum;

&nbsp; &nbsp;sum = i + c;
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog(@&quot;Value of sum : %d\n&quot;, sum );

&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p><pre>2013-09-11 01:38:28.492 demo[980] Value of sum : 116</pre>

<p>Here, value of sum is coming as 116 because compiler is doing integer promotion and converting the value of &apos;c&apos; to ascii before performing actual addition operation.</p>

<h2>Usual Arithmetic Conversion</h2>

<p>The <strong>usual arithmetic conversions</strong> are implicitly performed to cast their values in a common type. Compiler first performs <em>integer promotion</em>, if operands still have different types then they are converted to the type that appears highest in the following hierarchy:</p>

<p>The usual arithmetic conversions are not performed for the assignment operators, nor for the logical operators &amp;&amp; and ||. Let us take following example to understand the concept:</p><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

int main()
{
&nbsp; &nbsp;int &nbsp;i = 17;
&nbsp; &nbsp;char c = &apos;c&apos;; /* ascii value is 99 */
&nbsp; &nbsp;CGFloat sum;

&nbsp; &nbsp;sum = i + c;
&nbsp; &nbsp;NSLog(@&quot;Value of sum : %f\n&quot;, sum );
&nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;
}</pre>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p><pre>2013-09-11 01:41:39.192 demo[15351] Value of sum : 116.000000</pre>

<p>Here, it is simple to understand that first c gets converted to integer but because final value is float, so usual arithmetic conversion applies and compiler converts i and c into float and add them yielding a float result.</p>
