<p>The word <strong>polymorphism</strong> means having many forms. Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.</p>

<p>Objective-C polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.</p>

<p>Consider the example, we have a class Shape that provides the basic interface for all the shapes. Square and Rectangle are derived from the base class Shape.</p>

<p>We have the method printArea that is going to show about the OOP feature<strong>polymorphism</strong>.</p><pre>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

@interface Shape : NSObject

{
&nbsp; &nbsp; CGFloat area;
}

- (void)printArea;
- (void)calculateArea;
@end

@implementation Shape

- (void)printArea{
&nbsp; &nbsp; NSLog(@&quot;The area is %f&quot;, area);
}

- (void)calculateArea{

}

@end


@interface Square : Shape
{
&nbsp; &nbsp; CGFloat length;
}

- (id)initWithSide:(CGFloat)side;

- (void)calculateArea;

@end

@implementation Square

- (id)initWithSide:(CGFloat)side{
&nbsp; &nbsp; length = side;
&nbsp; &nbsp; return self;
}

- (void)calculateArea{
&nbsp; &nbsp; area = length * length;
}

- (void)printArea{
&nbsp; &nbsp; NSLog(@&quot;The area of square is %f&quot;, area);
}

@end

@interface Rectangle : Shape
{
&nbsp; &nbsp; CGFloat length;
&nbsp; &nbsp; CGFloat breadth;
}

- (id)initWithLength:(CGFloat)rLength andBreadth:(CGFloat)rBreadth;


@end

@implementation Rectangle

- (id)initWithLength:(CGFloat)rLength andBreadth:(CGFloat)rBreadth{
&nbsp; &nbsp; length = rLength;
&nbsp; &nbsp; breadth = rBreadth;
&nbsp; &nbsp; return self;
}

- (void)calculateArea{
&nbsp; &nbsp; area = length * breadth;
}

@end


int main(int argc, const char * argv[])
{
&nbsp; &nbsp; NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shape *square = [[Square alloc]initWithSide:10.0];
&nbsp; &nbsp; [square calculateArea];
&nbsp; &nbsp; [square printArea];
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shape *rect = [[Rectangle alloc]
&nbsp; &nbsp; initWithLength:10.0 andBreadth:5.0];
&nbsp; &nbsp; [rect calculateArea];
&nbsp; &nbsp; [rect printArea]; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; [pool drain];
&nbsp; &nbsp; return 0;

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p><pre>2013-09-22 21:21:50.785 Polymorphism[358:303] The area of square is 100.000000
2013-09-22 21:21:50.786 Polymorphism[358:303] The area is 50.000000</pre>

<p>In the above example based on the availability of the method calculateArea and printArea, either the method in the base class or the derived class executed.</p>

<p>Polymorphism handles the switching of methods between the base class and derived class based on the method implementation of the two classes.</p>
