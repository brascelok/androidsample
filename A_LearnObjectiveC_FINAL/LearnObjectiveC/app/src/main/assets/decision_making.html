<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/images/decision_making.jpg" alt="Decision making statements in Objective-C"></p>

<p>Objective-C programming language assumes any <strong>non-zero</strong> and <strong>non-null</strong> values as <strong>true</strong>, and if it is either <strong>zero</strong> or <strong>null</strong>, then it is assumed as <strong>false</strong> value.</p>

<p>Objective-C programming language provides following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their details:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Statement</th>
			<th>Description</th>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/if_statement_in_objective_c.htm" title="if statement in Objective-C">if statement</a></td>
			<td>An <strong>if statement</strong> consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/if_else_statement_in_objective_c.htm" title="if...else statement in Objective-C">if...else statement</a></td>
			<td>An <strong>if statement</strong> can be followed by an optional <strong>else statement</strong>, which executes when the boolean expression is false.</td>
		</tr>

			<td>You can use one <strong>if</strong> or <strong>else if</strong> statement inside another <strong>if</strong> or<strong>else if</strong> statement(s).</td>

<h2>The ? : Operator:</h2>

<p>We have covered <strong>conditional operator ? :</strong> in previous chapter which can be used to replace <strong>if...else</strong> statements. It has the following general form:</p><pre>Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;</pre>

<p>Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.</p>

<p>The value of a ? expression is determined like this: Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression. If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.</p>
